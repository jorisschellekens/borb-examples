## Exercise 1
### Multiple Choice:
Which `borb` class would you use to create a process diagram with a horizontal flow?

- [ ] `vertical_process`
- [ ] `horizontal_pie_process`
- [ ] `bending_process`
- [ ] `horizontal_process`

- [ ] `vertical_process`
- [ ] `horizontal_pie_process`
- [ ] `bending_process`
- [x] `horizontal_process`

The `horizontal_process` class is specifically designed to arrange process steps in a horizontal sequence.

## Exercise 2
### Multiple Choice:
Which `borb` list class is best suited for presenting an image with descriptive text in a vertical layout?

- [ ] `horizontal_picture_list`
- [ ] `vertical_picture_list`
- [ ] `block_list`
- [ ] `vertical_bullet_list`

- [ ] `horizontal_picture_list`
- [x] `vertical_picture_list`
- [ ] `block_list`
- [ ] `vertical_bullet_list`

The `vertical_picture_list` class allows you to arrange images with accompanying text in a vertical format.
</details>

## Exercise 3
### Multiple Choice:
Which of the following is NOT a valid `borb` list type?

- [ ] `horizontal_bullet_list`
- [ ] `pyramid`
- [ ] `table_list`
- [ ] `inverted_pyramid`

<details>

- [ ] `horizontal_bullet_list`
- [ ] `pyramid`
- [x] `table_list`
- [ ] `inverted_pyramid`

There is no `table_list` class in `borb`. The other options are valid list types.
</details>

## Exercise 4
### Multiple Choice:
Which process visualization class creates a diagram that bends and curves instead of following a strict linear layout?

- [ ] `horizontal_process`
- [ ] `vertical_process`
- [ ] `bending_process`
- [ ] `horizontal_pie_process`

<details>
<summary>Click here to view the solution</summary>

- [ ] `horizontal_process`
- [ ] `vertical_process`
- [x] `bending_process`
- [ ] `horizontal_pie_process`

The `bending_process` class allows for a more flexible, curved arrangement of process steps.
</details>

## Exercise 5
### True/False:
The `horizontal_ascending_list` in `borb` arranges items from left to right in decreasing order.

<details>
<summary>Click here to view the solution</summary>

False. The `horizontal_ascending_list` arranges items in an increasing order from left to right.
</details>

## Exercise 6
### True/False:
The `inverted_pyramid` list structure in `borb` visually emphasizes the most important information at the top and narrows down.

<details>
<summary>Click here to view the solution</summary>

True. The `inverted_pyramid` layout presents the most critical information first and then narrows down to supporting details.
